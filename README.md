# About

Source code for the programming exercises of my [NTUA ECE Programming Languages 2017-2018 course](https://courses.softlab.ntua.gr/pl1/2018a/).

Languages used:
* **C++** (imperative, object oriented)
* **Java** (imperative, object oriented)
* **Python** (scripting, imperative, object oriented)
* **Standard ML** (functional)
* **Prolog** (logical)

# Run

For each problem, a small set of test cases is included. To run each program:

```
$ g++ agora.cpp -o agora    # compile
$ ./a.out a2.txt            # [executable] [testcase]
```

# Short Description of each problem

## agora (C++, Standard ML, Prolog)

Given N numbers, calculate LCM of a subset of N-1 numbers.

## doomsday (C++, Java, Python)

Application of the flood fill algorithm

## mundial (Python, Prolog)

Given the results (matches played, goals scored and conceeded) of an elimination round-based tournament, find a possible set of matches for each round

## pistes (Java, Standard ML)

Find best achievable score in a game with consecutive rounds unlocked via keys.
